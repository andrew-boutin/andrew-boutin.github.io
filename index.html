                <p>
                    I'm a Software Engineer currently working in the private sector.<br>
                    I graduated from UNH with a BS in Computer Science a few years back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm constantly working on side projects outside of work.<br>
                    You can check out my <a href="https://github.com/andrew-boutin">GitHub</a>
                    to see all the projects I have going on.<br>
                    Some are small scale to learn a new technology, others because they're interesting,
                    and my favorites are video games.<br>
                    Sometimes my tech projects venture into hardware such as my custom PC and keyboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope something here inspires you!<br>
                    Feel free to reach out via any of the mediums that I've linked throughout this site!

                    I've gone through many iterations of this. Originally it was a static site hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet using Nginx.
                    Then I changed it up to a Django web application using Digital Ocean, Nginx, and uWSGI. Now I'm back to a static site, but hosted on
                    GitHub pages.

                    A chat app written in Go that allows you to chat with other users. Log in with Google to allow the app to know who you are.
                    See what other users are logged on, send messages, and receive messages. This project was primarily for learning Go and
                    brushing up on things such as Redis and Docker.

                    The EMMM (eeny, meeny, miny, moe) Slack Bot. Set this Slack bot up with your Slack workspace and you'll be able to "@emmm".
                    Emmm will choose a random user from the channel and respond with their @tag. There are some configuration options to do things
                    like ignore other bots present in the channel so they aren't chosen.

                <h2>Squares Clone <a href="https://github.com/andrew-boutin/squares-clone"><img class="repo" src="images/repo.png"></a></h2>

                    python, pygame
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a clone of the popular <a href="http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/games/squares2">Squares 2</a> game.
                    Black and red blocks move across the screen at varying speeds. The player's cursor is also a black square.
                    The object of the game is for the player to collect other black squares with their cursor.
                    They gain points and their cursor size increases. If the player hits a red square the game ends.
                    The speed of all the blocks increases as the game progresses. It's a very simple but addicting game.

                    Play <a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/EclisionGames/geo-wars">Geo Wars</a>!
                    The game is hosted on Kongregate and requires FireFox with WebPlayer.
                    If you have a Kongregate account then you can get your high score saved on the site.
                    This is a simple 2D platformer shooter. You have to avoid fatal terrain and different kinds of enemies to beat the levels.
                    This was a group project where I did all of the game dev except for the concept and art work.
                    I can't share the source code because of this.
