                I'm a Software Engineer currently working in the private sector.
                I graduated from UNH with a BS in Computer Science a few years back.
                <br>
                I'm constantly working on side projects outside of work.
                You can check out my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andrew-boutin">GitHub</a> to see all the projects I have going on.
                Some are small scale to learn a new technology, others because they're interesting, and my favorites are video games.
                Sometimes my tech projects venture into hardware such as my custom PC and keyboard.
                <br>
                I hope something here inspires you!
                Feel free to reach out via any of the mediums that I've linked throughout this site!

                    Play <a target="blank" href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/EclisionGames/geo-wars">Geo Wars</a> on Kongregate.
                    Requires either IE11 or Safari with WebPlayer
                    (Unity stopped supporting WebPlayer so the game most likely won't load on the site). If you have a Kongregate
                    account then you can get your high score saved on the site. This is a simple 2D platformer shooter. You have to
                    avoid fatal terrain and different kinds of enemies to beat the levels. This was a group project where I did all
                    of the game dev except for the concept and art work. I can't share the source code because of this.

                <p>
                    This is a clone of the popular Squares 2 game. Black and red blocks move across the screen at varying speeds. The
                    object of the game is for the player to collect black squares. They gain points and their size increases. If the
                    player hits a red square the game ends. The speed of all the blocks increases as the game progresses. It's a very
                    simple but addicting game.
