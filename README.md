# My Personal Site

This is my [personal site](https://andrewboutin.com/) hosted with GitHub pages.

I made it with `html`, `css`, and `javascript`.

It also uses [MailHide.io](https://mailhide.io/) for sharing my email address.

Using [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) library.

## History

 I've gone through many iterations of this. Originally it was a static site hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet using Nginx. Then I changed it up to a Django web application using Digital Ocean, Nginx, and uWSGI. Now I'm back to a static site, but hosted on GitHub pages.
