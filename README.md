# My Personal Site

This is my [personal site](https://andrewboutin.com) hosted with GitHub pages.

I made it with html, css, javascript, [MailHide.io](https://mailhide.io/), and [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/).

## History

 I've gone through many iterations of this. Originally it was a static site hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet using Nginx: [personal-site-static-legacy](https://github.com/andrew-boutin/personal-site-static-legacy). Then I changed it up to a Django web application using Digital Ocean, Nginx, and uWSGI: [personal-site-django](https://github.com/andrew-boutin/personal-site-django). Now I'm back to a static site, but hosted on GitHub pages.
