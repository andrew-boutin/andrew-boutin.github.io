# My Personal Site

This is my [personal site](https://andrewboutin.com/) hosted with GitHub pages.

I made it with html, css, javascript, [MailHide.io](https://mailhide.io/), and [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/).

## History

 I've gone through many iterations of this. Originally it was a static site hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet using Nginx. Then I changed it up to a Django web application using Digital Ocean, Nginx, and uWSGI. Now I'm back to a static site, but hosted on GitHub pages.
